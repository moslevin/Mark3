    @brief  Thread scheduler function declarations

    This scheduler implements a very flexible type of scheduling, which has
    become the defacto industry standard when it comes to real-time operating
    systems.  This scheduling mechanism is referred to as priority round-
    robin.

    From the name, there are two concepts involved here:

    1)  Priority scheduling:

    Threads are each assigned a priority, and the thread with the highest
    priority which is ready to run gets to execute.

    2)  Round-robin scheduling:

    Where there are multiple ready threads at the highest-priority level,
    each thread in that group gets to share time, ensuring that progress is
    made.

    The scheduler uses an array of ThreadList objects to provide the necessary
    housekeeping required to keep track of threads at the various priorities.
    As s result, the scheduler contains one ThreadList per priority, with an
    additional list to manage the storage of threads which are in the
    "stopped" state (either have been stopped, or have not been started yet).
