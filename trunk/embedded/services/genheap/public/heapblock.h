/*!
 * \brief The HeapBlock class
 *
 * This class represents the metadata portion of any allocation, which
 * occurs before the data-portion of the allocation in memory.
 *
 * A heapblock is essentially a multi-dimensional linked-list node, which
 * allows the block to keep track of two things:
 *
 * 1) Its neighboring blocks within the heap
 * 2) The size-list to which the block belongs in the heap, and the
 *    next/previousblocks in that list.
 *
 * HeapBlock objects can be split - that is, a larger block can be split into
 * two smaller blocks, provided the requested block data can be satisfied
 * from the existing object's data.
 *
 * Likewise, HeapBlocks can be coalesced (joined together) when adjacent
 * blocks of memory are freed, allowing for existing blocks to effectivley
 * grow larger.
 *
 * Splitting is used during a typical heap allocation, and coalescing is
 * performed to join blocks together during deallocation/free operations.
 *
