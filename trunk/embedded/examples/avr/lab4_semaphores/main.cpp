Lab Example 4:  Using binary semaphores

In this example, we implement two threads, synchronized using a semaphore to
model the classic producer-consumer pattern.  One thread does work, and then
posts the semaphore indicating that the other thread can consume that work.
The blocking thread just waits idly until there is data for it to consume.

Lessons covered in this example include:
-Use of a binary semaphore to implement the producer-consumer pattern
-Synchronization of threads (within a single priority, or otherwise)
 using a semaphore

Takeaway:

Semaphores can be used to control which threads execute at which time.  This
allows threads to work cooperatively to achieve a goal in the system.
