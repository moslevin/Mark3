/*!
 * \brief The EventFlag class is a blocking object, similar to a semaphore or
 * mutex, commonly used for synchronizing thread execution based on events
 * occurring within the system.
 *
 * Each EventFlag object contains a 16-bit bitmask, which is used to trigger
 * events on associated threads.  Threads wishing to block, waiting for
 * a specific event to occur can wait on any pattern within this 16-bit bitmask
 * to be set.  Here, we provide the ability for a thread to block, waiting
 * for ANY bits in a specified mask to be set, or for ALL bits within a
 * specific mask to be set.  Depending on how the object is configured, the
 * bits that triggered the wakeup can be automatically cleared once a match
 * has occurred.
 *
