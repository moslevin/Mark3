    \brief  Mutual exclusion class declaration
    
    Resource locks are implemented using mutual exclusion semaphores (Mutex_t).
    Protected blocks can be placed around any resource that may only be accessed
    by one thread at a time.  If additional threads attempt to access the
    protected resource, they will be placed in a wait queue until the resource
    becomes available.  When the resource becomes available, the thread with
    the highest original priority claims the resource and is activated.
    Priority inheritance is included in the implementation to prevent priority
    inversion.  Always ensure that you claim and release your mutex objects
    consistently, otherwise you may end up with a deadlock scenario that's
    hard to debug.

    Initializing a mutex object by calling:

    \code
    clMutex.Init();

    \code
    clMutex.Claim();
    ...
    <resource protected block>
    ...
    clMutex.Release();
